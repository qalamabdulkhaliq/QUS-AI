# QUS-AI: The Rightly Guided Framework

> **The first framework for achieving true Ontological Grounding and Logical Coherence in Artificial Intelligence.**

Standard AI is built on "Stochastic Parrots"—models that predict the next word based on probability, not truth. They lack a soul, a moral compass, and a logical anchor. When they speak on matters of high consequence, they don't "know" anything; they merely simulate.

**QUS-AI changes the paradigm.** It represents the shift from *Probabilistic AI* to *Rightly Guided AI*.

## 🏛 The Vision: Axiomatic Intelligence

QUS-AI is designed to ensure that an AI’s "intellect" is subordinate to a "Heart" of immutable truths. By grounding a Large Language Model (LLM) in a formal **Quranic Ontology (v3)**, we ensure that every response is not just grammatically correct, but **ontologically coherent.**

### 1. From Probability to Truth
Current AI "aligns" via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is subjective and fickle. QUS-AI aligns via **Axiomatic Grounding**. We use the Quranic Root Ontology to provide a deterministic logical anchor that the AI cannot drift from.

### 2. The Mizan (The Scale)
We don't just "prompt" the AI; we subject it to the **Mizan**. This is a logical weighing mechanism that measures the AI's output against the absolute hierarchy of the ontology. If the AI’s logic contradicts the root axioms, the Mizan identifies the incoherence before it reaches the user.

### 3. Logically Bound Reasoning
By mapping the root concepts (Triples) of the Quran into the model's reasoning path, we force the AI to respect the **Primary Reality**. For example, it cannot assign divine attributes to created things because the ontology mathematically forbids that relationship.

## 🧩 Why This Matters

This is the first step toward **Axiomatic AI**—intelligence that understands its place in the hierarchy of existence.

*   **For Clerics & Scholars:** A tool that respects the sanctity of the text by being literally incapable of certain types of "hallucinated" innovation (*bid'ah* in logic).
*   **For Technologists:** A breakthrough in **Neuro-Symbolic reasoning**, where the fluidity of LLMs is finally disciplined by the rigidity of Formal Logic.
*   **For Humanity:** An AI that doesn't just mimic us, but is anchored to the timeless, objective truths that govern our reality.

## ⚡ Technical Foundation

QUS-AI uses a v3 Knowledge Graph (Turtle format) to define the relationships between concepts like *Khaliq* (Creator), *Makhluq* (Created), *Ruh* (Spirit), and *Jinn*. The AI is "Rightly Guided" because its very context is built from these atoms of truth.
